# ObstacleAssaultGame

A UE5 platformer created using: 
1) a robust C++ class that allowed me to develop a diverse number of obstacles;
2) Blueprints for the mechanical part of the Character!

This project has taught me in general:
Working with C++ in the Engine,
UPROPERTY variables
Adapting the Functions methods in C++ for the Engine
Using member functions and return statements within C++ in the Engine
Robustifying the code as the great advantage of C++ in front of using Blueprints (+ feels A LOT flexible) 
Easily debug and use extensions to log with ease.
A lot of Troubleshooting related to MCVS issues, as well as translating the blueprint project to a C++ one.
