# ObstacleAssaultGame

A UE5 platformer created using: 
1) a robust C++ class that allowed me to develop a diverse number of obstacles;
2) Blueprints for the mechanical part of the Character!

This project has taught me, in general, to:

Work with C++ in the Engine,

Use UPROPERTY variables

Adapt the Functions methods in C++ for the Engine

Use member functions and return statements within C++ in the Engine

Robustify the code as a great advantage of C++ in front of using Blueprints (+ feels A LOT flexible) 

Easily debug and use extensions to log with ease.

Troubleshoot a lot (usually related to MCVS issues, and as translating the blueprint project to a C++ one).
